# linear-algebra
jonlin1000's notes on anything vaguely algebraic.
The repo has shifted towards linear algebra in general as I realize that Axler is not the best book for most of my purposes.

Plus if I do get around to coding anything it will probably be implementations of matrix algorithms. So the repository seems suited for this purpose.
