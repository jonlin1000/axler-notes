Let's consider the subspace of solutions to say the equation $(T - rI)^mf = 0$ where $T$ is the left shift operator. One such basis is given by 
\[f(n) = r^n, f(n) = nr^n, \dots, f(n) = n^{m-1}r^n.\]

Instead, taking the generating function point of view, A natural basis for the space of generating functions these sequences is
\[\frac{1}{(1-rx)^m}, \frac{x}{(1-rx)^m}, \frac{x^2}{(1-rx)^m}, \dots, \frac{x^{m-1}}{(1-rx)^m}.\]

Another natural basis is
\[\frac{1}{1-rx}, \frac{1}{(1-rx)^2}, \dots, \frac{1}{(1-rx)^m}.\]

These basis elements correspond to the solutions $f_{r,k}(n) = \binom{n + k - 1}{n}r^n$.
